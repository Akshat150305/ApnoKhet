## üîí Security and Environment Management

This repository contains the source code for the ApnoKhet website. To maintain security and prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data, please adhere to the following rules:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Do Not Commit Secrets!**

Under no circumstances should you commit files or code containing sensitive information directly to this repository. This includes, but is not limited to:

* API Keys (e.g., for payment gateways, email services, Google Maps)
* Database credentials (username, password, connection strings)
* Application secret keys (e.g., Django `SECRET_KEY`, JWT secrets)
* `.env` files containing secrets
* Private certificates or keys

### Best Practices

1.  **Use Environment Variables:** All secrets and environment-specific configurations should be loaded from environment variables.
2.  **Use a `.env` file for Local Development:** Create a `.env` file in your local project root to store your keys for development.
3.  **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:** Ensure that the `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from ever being committed. If it's not there, add this line to your `.gitignore`:
    ```
    # Ignore environment variables file
    .env
    ```
4.  **Create an Example File:** Create a file named `.env.example` or `env.sample` that lists all the required variables without their values. This file *should* be committed to the repository to show other developers what keys they need to set up their own environment.

    *Example `.env.example` file:*
    ```ini
    # Database Configuration
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=
    DB_PASSWORD=
    DB_NAME=apnokhet_db

    # Third-Party Services
    EMAIL_HOST_USER=
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
    STRIPE_API_KEY=
    ```
